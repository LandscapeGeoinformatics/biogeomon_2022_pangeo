Version control is better than mailing files back and forth:

- Nothing that is committed to version control is ever lost, unless you work really, really hard at it. Since all old versions of files are saved, it’s always possible to go back in time to see exactly who wrote what on a particular day, or what version of a program was used to generate a particular set of results.

- As we have this record of who made what changes when, we know who to ask if we have questions later on, and, if needed, revert to a previous version, much like the “undo” feature in an editor.

- When several people collaborate in the same project, it’s possible to accidentally overlook or overwrite someone’s changes. The version control system automatically notifies users whenever there’s a conflict between one person’s work and another’s.

Teams are not the only ones to benefit from version control: lone researchers can benefit immensely. Keeping a record of what was changed, when, and why is extremely useful for all researchers if they ever need to come back to the project later on (e.g., a year later, when memory has faded).

Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world: it’s what professionals use to keep track of what they’ve done and to collaborate with other people. Every large software development project relies on it, and most programmers use it for their small jobs as well. And it isn’t just for software: books, papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored in a version control system.

Since 1998, Software Carpentry has been teaching researchers the computing skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain. Our volunteer instructors have run hundreds of events for more than 34,000 researchers since 2012. All of our lesson materials are freely reusable under the Creative Commons - Attribution license.

The Software Carpentry Foundation and its sibling lesson project, Data Carpentry, have merged to become The Carpentries, a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initiatives, a 501(c)3 non-profit incorporated in the United States. See the staff page for The Carpentries.

Reproducibility guidelines

AGILE Reproducible Paper Guidelines - December 2020.pdf

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility#Reproducible_research

Reproducible research is a crucial topic for any research domain using computational processes, including GIScience and EarthSciences. Recent research has shown, that many publications leave room for improvement regarding their computational reproducibility.  The AGILE council generously supports an initiative for development of new guidelines for AGILE conference submissions to improve reproducibility. The planned duration of the initiative is January 2019 to June 2019. The initiative will prepare new author guidelines and reviewer guidelines suitable for all submission types (full, short, poster).
